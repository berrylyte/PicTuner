# PicTuner

PicTuner is a simple and lightweight web tool designed for sketch training. When practicing sketching for different purposes, the time spent on each sketch may vary. This tool allows users to set a timer to automatically switch through images in a folder, helping to streamline sketching exercises.

## Features
- **Custom Timer**: Set specific durations for displaying each image.
- **Folder Support**: Load images directly from a local folder for playback.
- **Progress Tracking**: Remembers the last displayed image for a given folder, allowing you to resume from where you left off.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Minimalist design focused on ease of use.

## Interface
The website consists of the following main modules:
1. **Timer Module**: Allows users to set the time interval for image display.
2. **Image Display Module**: Displays the currently loaded image.
3. **Countdown Module**: Shows the remaining time before switching to the next image.
4. **Image Switch Module**: Automatically changes images based on the set timer.
